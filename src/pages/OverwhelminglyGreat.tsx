                    The Corp has crumbled. You’ve not only crushed their empire,
                    you’ve sent shockwaves through the entire city. News of
                    their downfall spreads like wildfire, and for once, it’s the
                    people of <strong>NeonHollow</strong> who are celebrating.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The city is yours, and you’ve rewritten its future in a
                    single, devastating blow. Your name will be whispered in awe
                    across the streets for years to come.
                </p>

                    You notice the lights dimming, gradually fading until
                    everything is engulfed in complete darkness.
