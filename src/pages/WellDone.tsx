                    The Corp is no more. You’ve dismantled their influence and
                    shattered their operations. <strong>NeonHollow</strong> will
                    breathe easier now, though it will take time for the dust to
                    settle.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You’ve done well — this victory may be only the beginning of
                    something bigger. Still, tonight, you’ve earned your place
                    among the shadows.
                </p>

                    You notice the lights dimming, gradually fading until
                    everything is engulfed in complete darkness.

                <p>From afar, a familiar sound echoes...</p>
                <p>
                    <em>"Wake up, Shadowrunner. You are worthy."</em>
